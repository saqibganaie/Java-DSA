This repo contains my DSA codes in Java. 
Each topic is divided into branches and each branch contains a 'practice' folder and a 'questions' folder.
The 'practice' folder contains all the codes that I wrote while practicing that topic and the 'questions' folder contains the solutions of the questions which were given by the youtube playlist.
As the branches will get completed they will be merged with the master branch.
